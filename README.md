## How To Update My Own

When you fork or clone this repository, your website will not be able to use Google Authentication unless you add your own Google Auth from [Google Developer Portal](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  Once loged in, you must setup the OAuth Screen.

### OAuth
Setting up the OAuth is easy, you just have to define what the app does and what scopes you will be using. The scopes use are

- Google Drive API - `./auth/drive.aoodata`
- Google Drive API - `./auth/drive.fille`
- YouTube Data API v3 - `./auth/youtube/readonly`

After you have enabled all these scopes, under the ***Credentials*** tab, Create a new API key and a new OAuth Client ID for Web application. make sure you put your website link as ***Authorized JavaScript origins*** and ***Authorized redirect URIs***.

With your **API KEY** and your **OAuth Client ID**
replace client ID and API key inside src/main.jsx
like so:

```
import  React  from  'react'

import  ReactDOM  from  'react-dom/client'

import  App  from  './App.jsx'

import  './index.css'

import { GoogleOAuthProvider } from  '@react-oauth/google';

  

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(

<React.StrictMode>

<GoogleOAuthProvider  clientId="CLIENT_ID">

<App  clientID="CLIENT ID"

APIKey="API KEY"/>

</GoogleOAuthProvider>

</React.StrictMode>,

)
```
